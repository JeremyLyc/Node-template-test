00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:49,400
原谅我。摇滚音乐，对不起，我们是爵士音乐商店，我们没有摇滚音乐。
Excuse me.Where's your rock music section Rock music, I'm sorry, we're a jazz store, we don't have any rock and roll.

8
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:54,090
哦 你只有爵士乐 没有别的了
Oh, you only have jazz music, nothing else.

9
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,760
没错 我们是伦敦唯一一家专门卖爵士乐的唱片店
That's right, we're the only record store in London dedicated exclusively to jazz.

10
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:06,820
事实上 我们不仅仅是一家唱片店 我们楼上有咖啡厅和图书馆
Actually, we're more than just a record store. We have a cafe and library upstairs.

11
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:13,890
大厅尽头有个售票处 你可以在那里买到城里所有大型爵士音乐会的票
And a ticket office down the hall where you can buy tickets to all the major jazz concerts in the city.

12
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:20,680
此外 我们在隔壁有自己的工作室 为有前途的艺术家复制专辑
Also, we have our own studio next door where reproduce albums for up and coming artists.

13
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:26,190
我们致力于培养新的音乐人才 哇 这是很酷
We're committed to fostering new music talent. Wow. That's so cool.

14
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:34,760
我想现在已经没有爵士乐坛了 不像以前那样了 但你却在努力推广这种伟大的音乐流派
I guess there's not much of a jazz scene anymore, not like they used to be, but here you're trying to promote this great music genre.

15
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,980
是的 的确 现在大多数人喜欢听流行音乐和摇滚音乐
Yes, indeed, nowadays most people like to listen to pop and rock music.

16
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,790
来自美国的嘻哈音乐也越来越受欢迎
Hip hop music from America is also getting more and more popular.

17
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:54,560
因此 爵士乐的听众越来越少 这是一个很大的遗憾 因为它是一种非常丰富的音乐类型
So as a result, there are fewer listeners of jazz, which is a great shame, because it's an incredibly rich genre.

18
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:01,700
但这并不是说现在就没有好的爵士乐了 远非如此
But that's not to say there isn't any good new jazz music being made out there anymore, far from it.

19
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,910
只是现在的市场很小
It's just a much smaller market today.

20
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,760
那么你如何定义爵士乐呢
So how would you define jazz?

21
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:16,880
有趣的是 对于爵士乐并没有统一的定义 的确 爵士乐有许多不同的风格
Well, interestingly enough, there's no agreed upon definition of jazz. Indeed, there are many different styles of jazz.

22
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:25,730
有些人会唱歌 但大多数人不会 有些是电动的 有些不是 有些包含现场实验 但并不总是如此
Some have singing, but most don't. Some are electric and some aren't. Some contain live experimentation, but not always.

23
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:31,670
虽然它没有一个简单的定义 虽然有许多不同的风格的爵士乐
While there's no simple definition for it, and while there are many different styles of jazz.

24
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:39,370
当你诚实地听爵士乐时 你就会知道它是什么 唯一知道它是什么的方法就是自己去听
You simply know it when you hear it honestly, the only way to know what jazz is is listen to it yourself.

25
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:45,380
就像伟大的小号手 失去阿姆斯特朗说的 如果你问 你永远不会知道
As the great trumpet player, lose Armstrong said, if you got to ask, you'll never know.

26
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,710

今天早上是怎么到银行去的
How did it go to the bank this morning?

34
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:14,950
不太好 我的提议被拒绝了 真的 但为什么
Not well, my proposal was rejected, really, but why.

35
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,640
一堆原因 首先 他们说我的信用记录不够好
Bunch of reasons, for starters, they said my credit history was not good enough.

36
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,530
他们有没有说要怎么改进
Did they say how you could improve that?

37
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:33,330
是的 他们说在我还了5年的抵押贷款后 我将成为一个更可行的商业贷款候选人
Yes, they said that after five more years of paying my mortgage, then I would become a more viable candidate for a business loan.

38
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:41,540
但是现在 他们借钱给我太冒险了 他们担心我会拖欠给我的商业贷款
But right now, it's too risky for them to lend me money. They fear I will default on any business loan I'm given.

39
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:49,320
听起来不公平 你的商业想法太棒了 你给他们看过你的商业计划了吗他们怎么说
Well, that doesn't sound fair. Your business idea is amazing. Did you show them your business plan What did they say.

40
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,630
对于实际的商业计划 他们并没有明确表达任何立场
They didn't really articulate any position regarding the actual business plan.

41
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,280
他们只是看了我的信用记录
They simply looked at my credit history.

42
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:05,560
并认为这还不够好 他们说 银行对贷款对象有严格的指导原则和要求
And determined it was not good enough. They said the bank has strict guidelines and requirements as to who they can lend money to.

43
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,080
我根本达不到他们的财务门槛
And I simply don't meet their financial threshold.

44
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:17,390
也许你可以从其他渠道筹集资金 从更多的贷款人那里获得小额贷款
What have you asked for a smaller amount Maybe you could gather capital from other sources, smaller loans from more lenders.

45
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:22,550
你不明白 我只求 大小无关紧要
You don't get it. It doesn't matter the size of alone, I ask for.

46
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,020
或者我提议的业务类型
Or the type of business I propose.

47
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:34,130
这都是无关紧要的 每家银行要做的第一件事就是研究我有多少钱和多少债务
That's all inconsequential. The first thing every bank will do is study how much money I have and how much debt I have.

48
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:43,600
在他们决定是否借给我更多的钱之前 如果我想继续这个梦想只有我自己的生意
Before they decide whether or not to lend me any more money, if I want to continue ahead with this dream of only my own business.

I need around 20% more in personal savings and 50% less debt, that's all there is to it.

51
00:05:56,340 --> 00:06:02,140
我现在明白了 很遗憾他们拒绝了你的请求 但不要失去希望
I see now, well, it's a huge pity that they rejected your request, but don't lose hope.
